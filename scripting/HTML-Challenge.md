# HTML Challenge
## Requirement
Write, using any language of your choice, a function that would retrieve and print out the Title, i.e. the text in between the HTML title tags, from an HTML page.
Also, write another function that would retrieve and print out the HTTP response status code, i.e. 200, from the same HTML page.

## Expected output
For example, for http://www.brainjar.com/java/host/test.html, the expected outputs would be 'Test HTML File' for the first function, and '200' for the second function.
